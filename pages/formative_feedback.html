        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>Our evaluation consisted of two main parts: a formal usability evaluation with target users and an internal heuristic evaluation.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Formal Usability Evaluation</h3>
        <p>We conducted formal usability tests with several participants. The findings, observations, and recordings are documented below:</p>

        <h3>1.1 Summary of Quantitative Results</h3>
        <div class="placeholder-text">
            <p>[Insert summary of quantitative results here. This could include task completion rates, time on task, error rates, and average scores from post-test questionnaires (e.g., SUS scores, 1-5 ratings for ease of use, etc.).]</p>
            <p>For example: Task 1 (Setup) had a 100% completion rate, but an average time of 6.5 minutes, exceeding our 5-minute goal. Task 4 (Adjust Brightness) had a 30% failure rate on the first attempt...</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1.2 Summary of Qualitative Results</h3>
        <div class="placeholder-text">
            <p>[Insert summary of qualitative feedback from think-aloud protocols and user comments. Focus on key themes and impressions.]</p>
            <p>For example: Most participants expressed confusion about the "Widgets" terminology. Several users praised the minimalist design but felt the text was too small to be read from a distance...</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1.3 Similarities and Differences Across Participants</h3>
        <div class="placeholder-text">
            <p>[Insert analysis of patterns across all users. What did everyone agree on? Where did their opinions or behaviors differ?]</p>
            <p><strong>Similarities:</strong> All participants successfully located the time and weather. None of the participants understood how to access settings via the "long press" method initially.</p>
            <p><strong>Differences:</strong> Participant 1 (tech-savvy) wanted more customization options, while Participant 2 (older adult) preferred fewer on-screen elements...</p>

        <h3>1.4 Observations Based on Usability Goals</h3>
        <div class="placeholder-text">
            <p>[Insert reflections on how the test results map back to your original usability goals from the test plan.]</p>
            <p><strong>Goal 1 (Minimalist Design):</strong> Achieved, but at the cost of Goal 2.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal 2 (Familiarity/Recognition):</strong> Partially failed. The hidden "long press" for settings violated this goal. The gear icon in Prototype 1, however, was 100% successful...</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1.5 Failure Cases</h3>
        <div class="placeholder-text">
            <p>[Insert a description of the most critical or common failure cases observed. What tasks did users fail to complete, and why?]</p>
            <p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> Accessing Settings (Prototype 2). Users looked for a visual icon and, finding none, assumed settings could not be changed. This led to task abandonment for 2 out of 3 participants...</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1.6 Summary of Usability Issues</h3>
        <div class="placeholder-text">
            <p>[Insert a high-level summary of the key usability problems identified, perhaps prioritized by severity (e.g., critical, major, minor).]</p>
            <p>1. <strong>(Critical)</strong> Settings are undiscoverable (Prototype 2).</p>
            <p>2. <strong>(Major)</strong> Text size is not legible from a standard distance.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>(Minor)</strong> Terminology for "Widgets" is confusing...</p>

            <p>[Insert a few direct, impactful quotes from your test participants.]</p>
            <p><em>"I would never have found that. Why would you hide it?"</em> - Participant 2 (re: long-press settings)</p>
            <p><em>"It's pretty, but I'd have to squint or walk closer, which defeats the purpose."</em> - Participant 1 (re: text size)</p>

        <h2>Test Plan Critique</h2>
        <div class="placeholder-text">
            <p>[Insert your critique of Group A's test plan here. What was good about it? What was weak? Was it easy to follow? Did it test the right things?]</p>
            <p>For example: The test plan from Group A was comprehensive and clearly outlined its usability goals. The benchmark tasks were well-aligned with these goals, particularly Task 3 (Checking Weather) and Task 6 (Using as a Mirror). The scripts were neutral and avoided leading questions.</p>
            <p>However, the plan's time estimates were overly optimistic, leading to our sessions running longer than anticipated. Furthermore, the plan did not include a specific task for error recovery (e.g., "What happens if Wi-Fi disconnects?"), which would have been valuable to observe...</p>

        <h2>Design Critique</h2>
        <div class="placeholder-text">
            <p>[Insert your critique of Group A's *design* based on your test findings. What design decisions were strong? Which ones were weak and led to the usability issues you found?]</p>
            <p>For example: The design's strongest feature is its "calm" aesthetic, which all participants appreciated. The decision to place information in the corners (Modification #3) was validated during testing, as users felt it maximized reflection space.</p>
            <p>The design's primary weakness was its over-reliance on "invisible" interactions, such as the long-press for settings. This design choice, while intended to be minimal, directly caused our most critical failure case and demonstrates a conflict between the designers' aesthetic goals and core usability principles like "Recognition Rather Than Recall"...</p>
