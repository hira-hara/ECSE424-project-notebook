                <h2>1. Results and Analysis</h2>

                <h3>1.1 Summary of Quantitative Results</h3>
                <div class="placeholder-text">
                    <p>In general, the duration of each task took longer than the expected task. Although for tasks 6
                        and 7, we
                        got the expected time duration. The first two tasks took the longest and they needed the most
                        assistance
                        from the investigators to complete the task. Every task was completed and each subtask was
                        completed.
                        Core functionality tasks took the expected amount of time and showed that the ease of use for
                        the
                        software interface was easier than the initial setup. The initial setup needing assistance
                        showed that
                        there is an ease-of-use problem for non-technical people who aren’t familiar with GitHub. </p>
                </div>

                <h3>1.2 Summary of Qualitative Results</h3>
                <div class="placeholder-text">
                    <p><b>Observer 1:</b> Our first participant is a university student who did have some technical
                        knowledge.
                        They
                        followed the user manual but were stuck on the first task because they were not sure how to
                        clone or
                        download repositories from GitHub. This made it difficult for them to start a flow and could
                        have
                        diminished their wanting to continue the project. With our assistance they continued. They had
                        difficulty choosing a serial port as well since they were not sure which one was the correct
                        one. We
                        assisted them for this step as well. The rest of the steps were easily followed. They understood
                        the
                        concept of the light changing and warnings when they switched tabs. Although they commented
                        multiple
                        times about how bright the light is. The user did not have to refer to the manual for the core
                        functionality tasks such as adding a site and removing it. Although they did not see a coffee
                        mug symbol
                        at first which led them to check the manual and disrupting their flow. This is likely a software
                        issue
                        thus making it fixed would give the proper usability effect of getting ample feedback.</p>

                    <p><b>Observer 2:</b> Our second participant is a volunteer (They volunteer in organisations). They
                        rated
                        themselves as not very tech-knowledgeable. They also had difficulty with Tasks 1 and 2, thus
                        requiring
                        assistance from us in order to complete the task. They mentioned that having computer knowledge
                        would
                        definitely help a lot more. Similarly, they progressed through the next parts easily. They
                        identified
                        the buttons and interface layout easily but were confused when they could not see the coffee mug
                        symbol
                        showing that the expectation of the user was not met but once again we believe this is a
                        software
                        problem that once fixed will solve this issue. They also mentioned how bright the led lights
                        were.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>1.3 Similarities and Differences Across Participants</h3>
                <div class="placeholder-text">
                    <p><strong>Similarities:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They both found the first two tasks difficult and frustrating.</li>
                        <li>They both mentioned that the light was too bright and “in their face”.</li>
                        <li>Participants expressed that the interface was easy to use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Differences:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Possibly a technical issue but the led lights turned on at Task 2 for User 1 and for User 2
                            it
                            turned on on Task 3 although we saw that they chose the correct serial port and followed the
                            steps
                            similarly
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>1.4 Observations Based on Usability Goals</h3>
                <div class="placeholder-text">
                    <p><b>Effectiveness of reminders (Learnability / Engagement):</b> All participants noticed the
                        pop-up
                        warning when
                        they were in a non-focus tab as well as the lights changing color to yellow. There was no
                        dimming effect
                        mentioned during the tasks and manual but mentioned in this Usability Goal so we are unsure
                        about that.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Awareness of breaks (Efficiency / Error Recovery):</b> The participants noticed the breaks and
                        knew
                        they could change the break times. </p>
                    <p><b>Ease of managing focus sites (Learnability / Efficiency):</b> The participants easily added
                        and
                        removed websites to and from the focus list. They found the interface very easy to understand.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Ease of starting/stopping sessions (Learnability / Efficiency):</b> The users easily stopped,
                        started
                        and paused sessions intuitively.</p>
                    <p><b>User satisfaction (Satisfaction / Engagement):</b> The users generally found the extension
                        satisfactory, although they mentioned they would not use it as often. They found the light a bit
                        disturbing because it was very bright. They had no comment about motivation. </p>
                </div>

                <h3>1.5 Failure Cases</h3>
                <div class="placeholder-text">
                    <ul>
                        <li>For both participants, a “failure” case would be to identify the coffee cup symbol in the
                            first half
                            of the study session. The coffee mug did not appear at first and thus they told us that they
                            did not
                            see it anywhere. This might show the system is unpredictable for this case. </li>
                        <li>For both participants, mentioned before we believe the first step would have failed unless
                            we helped
                            them or would take a considerable amount of time since they would have to search up the
                            internet and
                            understand how GitHub and repositories work.</li>
                        <li>For both participants, they chose the wrong serial port initially and had to go through
                            trial and
                            error since there was no instructions on the manual which port should be selected. Showing
                            that the
                            manual should be a bit more comprehensive for people with minimal amounts of technical
                            knowledge.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                                    evaluators noticed that the first few steps seemed a bit more technical and our
                                    observations
                                    justified our assumptions since the participants did need help for them.</li>

                                    study sites are added. This was confusing by the participants and forced the user
                                    into a
                                    dead end where they must "either have to add the site... or remove the extension" in
                                    order
                                    to remove the warning sign.</li>

                                    The users indicated that they did not see a coffee mug at first. This reduces
                                    discoverability and requires users to remember contextual cues for their study

                                <li>During the evaluation, one of the participants tried to click on the pomodoro timer

                                    and tried to change the timer to a different time. But they were not successful
                                    since the
                                    implementation is meant only for 25 minutes. This could be a lack of flexibility for
                                    users
                                    but we understand that it might have been a hardware/software limitation.</li>

                                    tool, this distraction undermines its core purpose. Although since this is a
                                    prototype, the
                                    light will likely be integrated into the whole design in a way that it is covered
                                    and not
                                    too bright.</li>

                <h2>2. Test Plan Critique</h2>
                <div class="placeholder-text">
                    <p>The FocusBrowse test plan is clear, well organized and effectively connects to the system’s
                        usability
                        goals and calm technology principles. It uses two methods, a usability test with real users and
                        a
                        heuristic evaluation by experts, to assess both the practical user experience and the interface
                        quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>Each usability goal, like effectiveness of reminders, awareness of breaks, ease of controlling
                        sessions,
                        intuitive session control and overall satisfaction were matched with specific and measurable
                        indicators.
                        For example, user feedback awareness (goal 1) was tested through the warning bar and LED lights
                        (Visibility of System Status),
                        while ease of session control (goal 4) was linked to the heuristic of user control and freedom
                        through
                        timing and error tracking.
                        The minimalist and satisfaction goals were measured through post-test Likert ratings,
                        ensuring that every design goal had a clear evaluation method, fulfilling the requirement for a
                        complete
                        and goal driven evaluation plan.</p>
                    <p>Some improvements were made to better match users’ real skills and behaviors. The updated plan
                        incorporated clearer
                        pre-test instructions, a step by step user manual and simplified terminology in tasks such as
                        LED setup
                        and repository
                        cloning. These changes helped focus the test on usability instead of technical setup. The team
                        also
                        standardized task scripts to keep evaluations consistent and
                        added quantitative benchmarks to make the performance outcomes directly comparable across
                        participants.
                    </p>
                    <p>The heuristic evaluation parallel to the usability testing complemented each other very well.
                        Expert
                        reviewers
                        evaluated FocusBrowse against Nielsen’s ten heuristics, identifying strengths in consistency and
                        standards and
                        aesthetic and minimalist design while noting moderate issues in error prevention and help and
                        documentation. This method ensured
                        coverage of both user and design centered perspectives, getting better feedback and objective
                        data.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the revised plan fits the project’s goals very well. It measures the right things, uses
                        appropriate
                        HCI methods, and ensures that the feedback collected is both practical and useful for improving
                        FocusBrowse’s calm, user centered design. The added quantitative criteria and expert
                        review components ensure that resulting data will be both reliable and meaningful for future
                        iterations.
